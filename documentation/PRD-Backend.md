## 3. Background and Strategic Fit

### Why We're Building This
The backend serves as the foundation for a modern quote management system that allows users to create, share, and interact with inspirational quotes. It supports two different frontend implementations (Next.js and NiceGUI) while maintaining a single source of truth for data.

### Strategic Alignment
- **Technology Stack**: Modern Python-based API using FastAPI
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- **Authentication**: JWT-based secure authentication
- **Scalability**: Async/await patterns for high concurrency
- **API-First**: RESTful API design for frontend flexibility

## 4. Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- MongoDB will be available and properly configured
- Frontend applications will handle client-side state management
- JWT tokens will be used for session management
- CORS will be configured for frontend domains
- Environment variables will be properly set

### Business Assumptions
- Users will primarily interact through web interfaces
- Quote content will be text-based with metadata
- User engagement will be measured through likes/dislikes
- Search functionality will be a key feature
- Personalization will enhance user experience

### User Assumptions
- Users expect fast response times (< 200ms for most operations)
- Users want secure authentication without frequent re-logins
- Users expect real-time updates for social interactions
- Users will search for quotes by content, author, or tags

## 6. User Interaction and Design

### API Design Principles
- **RESTful**: Follow REST conventions for resource management
- **Consistent**: Uniform response formats across all endpoints
- **Secure**: JWT authentication with proper validation
- **Documented**: Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Versioned**: API versioning for future compatibility

### Database Design
- **User Collection**: Store user profiles and preferences
- **Quote Collection**: Store quotes with metadata and interactions
- **Indexing**: Optimized indexes for search and filtering
- **Relationships**: Proper references between users and quotes

### Security Design
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt for password security
- **CORS**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic schemas for data validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse

## 7. Questions and Decisions

### Technical Decisions
- **Database Choice**: MongoDB selected for flexibility and scalability
- **Authentication**: JWT chosen over session-based for stateless design
- **Async Framework**: FastAPI selected for performance and type safety
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated Swagger UI for developer experience

### Open Questions
- Should we implement real-time notifications for social interactions?
- Do we need to add quote categories or collections?
- Should we implement quote sharing functionality?
- Do we need analytics endpoints for user behavior tracking?
